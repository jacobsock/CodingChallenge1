# CodingChallenge1

Objective: Combine your knowledge of variables, constants, types and basic operators to create a comprehensive summary of a theoretical app's information. This exercise will test your ability to declare and manipulate different data types, use variables and constants appropriately, and format output.

Instructions:

Declare Constants and Variables:

Create constants for:
- App name (String)
- Developer name (String)
- Initial release year (Int)

Create variables for:
- Current version (Double)
- Number of downloads (Int)
- User rating (Double, out of 5.0)

Assign Initial Values:
- Assign appropriate initial values of your choosing to these constants and variables
- Print the initial values with descriptive text.

Simulate an update where:
- The version number is incremented by 0.1
- The number of downloads increases by 1000
- The user rating improves by 0.2
- Print the updated values with descriptive text.

---------------------
Challenge Tasks:

1) Create a new feature for your app:
- Add a new variable for the description of the new feature (String).
- Assign it a value and print it.

2) Collect Feedback:
- Declare a variable to store the number of positive reviews (Int) and negative reviews (Int).
- Assign initial values and print the total number of reviews.

3) Calculate and Print the New Rating:
- Assume each positive review adds 0.1 to the user rating and each negative review subtracts 0.1.
- Update the user rating accordingly and print the new rating.
